# Source That Car

This is the front-end code for www.sourcethatcar.co.uk

## Potential Ongoing Costs of Site

These are the costs associated with any libraries or services that the site makes use of during deployment

1. domain registrar subscription - the cost associated with keeping your sourcethatcar.co.uk/com domains
2. hosting - this is currently provided via netlify on their free tier. Costs start to become incurred once the traffic on your site exceeds the included allowances provided by the free tier (but they're quite generous allowances).
3. email.js - this is a library that we're using to email the details filled in on the contact form to yourself, as well as for sending a confirmation email to the visitor to reassure them that you've received their message. Again this is a service that provides a free tier (200 monthly requests), and if/once you exceed their limits there's the opportunity to subscribe to increase these allowances.
